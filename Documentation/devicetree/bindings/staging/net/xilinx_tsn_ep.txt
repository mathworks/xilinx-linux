Xilinx TSN (time sensitive networking) EndPoint Driver (xilinx_tsn_ep)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
- compatible		: Should be "xlnx,tsn-ep"
- reg			: Physical base address and size of the TSN Endpoint
				registers map
- interrupts		: Property with a value describing the interrupt
- interrupts-names	: Property denotes the interrupt names.
- interrupt-parent	: Must be core interrupt controller.
- local-mac-address	: See ethernet.txt [1].

Optional properties:
- xlnx,num-tc		: Number of traffic class supported in current design,
			  range is 2,3 and default value is 3. It denotes
			  the traffic classes based on VLAN-PCP value.
- xlnx,channel-ids 	: Queue Identifier associated with the MCDMA Channel, range
			  is Tx: "1 to 2" and Rx: "2 to 5", default value is "1 to 5".
- xlnx,eth-hasnobuf	: Used when 1G MAC is configured in non processor mode.
- axistream-connected-rx	: Reference to another node which contains the
				  resources for the MCDMA controller used by
				  this device. The MCDMA related resources
				  (registers and interrupts) will be used from
				  this node.

Optional TADMA properties:
- xlnx,num-buffers-per-stream	: Number of TADMA buffers per stream in design. Default is 64.
- xlnx,num-streams		: Number of streams. Default is 8.
- xlnx,num-fetch-entries	: Maximum number of entries that can be programmed to be
				  fetched by TADMA. Default is 8.
- axistream-connected-tx	: Reference to another node which contains the
				  resources for the TADMA controller used by
				  this device. The TADMA-related resources
				  (registers and interrupts) will be used from
				  this node.

Optional MCDMA properties:
- xlnx,num-mm2s-channels	: Number of MM2S(read) channels in MCDMA
- xlnx,num-s2mm-channels	: Number of S2MM(write) channels in MCDMA

		local-mac-address = [00 0A 35 00 01 10];
		xlnx,channel-ids = "1","2","3","4","5";
		xlnx,eth-hasnobuf ;
